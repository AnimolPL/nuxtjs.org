In this example we show:

- how to add an svg to the `<img>` tag from the assets folder. We also show how to add a background image.
- how to add a css file to your project so it is globally available by adding it to the `css` property in the `nuxt.config.js` file.
- how to reference the DMSans fonts from the assets folder using the `@font-face` rule in the `main.css` file.
